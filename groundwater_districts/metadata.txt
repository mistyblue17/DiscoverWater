      Title: GMD 
  Description: 
    Abstract: 
      This dataset outlines the location of the five Groundwater Management Districts in Kansas.  
      GMDs are locally formed and elected boards for regional groundwater management and economical 
      groundwater usage.  GMDs are composed of a manager and staff with the exact area of each GMD 
      is defined by its respective board.
    Purpose: 
      Developed for general GIS usage within the KDA-Division of Water Resources.
